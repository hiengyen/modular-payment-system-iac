Architecture Documentation
Overview
This project implements a modular payment processing architecture using AWS services, managed by Terraform version >=1.2 with AWS provider version 6.2.0. The architecture is designed to be scalable, secure, and maintainable across multiple environments (dev, staging, prod).
Components

Networking (VPC): A VPC with public and private subnets, NAT gateways, and internet gateways for network isolation and connectivity.
Security: Security groups, WAF, and IAM roles to ensure secure access and protect APIs.
Cognito: User authentication and authorization using AWS Cognito user pools.
S3: Storage for data and artifacts, with versioning and server-side encryption.
Database: Aurora PostgreSQL for relational data and DynamoDB for NoSQL data.
ECR: Container image storage for banking API and AI/ML workloads.
ECS: Container orchestration for running the banking API.
Lambda: Serverless functions for routing and processing tasks.
API Gateway: REST API endpoint with Cognito authentication and WAF protection.
Messaging: SQS and SNS for asynchronous communication.
Analytics: Kinesis Firehose for data streaming and QuickSight for visualization.
AI/ML: SageMaker for machine learning model deployment.
Monitoring: CloudWatch dashboards and alarms for infrastructure monitoring.

Network Flow

External traffic enters via API Gateway, protected by WAF.
API Gateway routes requests to ECS (banking API) or Lambda functions.
ECS and Lambda access Aurora, DynamoDB, and S3 for data storage.
SageMaker processes ML tasks and publishes results to SNS.
Kinesis Firehose streams data to S3 for analytics, visualized in QuickSight.
CloudWatch monitors all components.

Security Considerations

IAM roles with least privilege principles, defined in policies/.
Cognito for user authentication.
WAF to protect against common web attacks.
Encryption at rest for S3 and Aurora.
VPC security groups to restrict traffic.
